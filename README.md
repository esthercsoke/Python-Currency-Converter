## Description
<What your application does>

This python terminal application uses the [Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app/) API to retrieve the current conversion rates between the inputs of 2 currency codes of a certain date using a date input. It returns the conversion and and an inverse conversion rate between the two currencies.


<Which Python version you used>

:snake: <b>Python:</b> 
Version: 3.8.9


<Which packages and version you used>

:package: <b>Packages used:</b>
- requests 2.28.1

Check out the requests documentation [here](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)


<Some of the challenges you faced>
<b>Challenges </b>

- Initially understanding the code structure. 
- Have worked in React JS for so long. I found difficult at first adapting to Python.
- Unit Testing, as I have only worked using strenuous and time consuming manual testing :muscle:

<b> Future Implementation:</b>

- Add fun terminal input to create a user interface in the terminal.
- Ability to download results to CSV.
- Add another argument for custom currency amount.


## How to Setup
<Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.>

- Make sure you have Python on your computer. [Check here for installing Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install the needed packages using `pip install <package>==<version number>`. Check the [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) documentaton for more information. 


## How to Run the Program
<Provide instructions and examples>

1. Download directory folder.
   <br>
2. In your terminal use `cd` to move into the folder directory.

In the terminal use the basic code structure of



```python
python main.py <date> <currency origin> <currency destination>
```



For example:

<center>


```python

$ python main.py 2021-07-16 GBP AUD
```

</center>
<br>
<b>The argument values in the terminal app have some rules:</b>

`date` Must have the format of `Y-m-d` (<i>e.g '2020-01-01'</i>)

`currency` Must be one of the valid currency abbreviations.
